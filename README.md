# whos_that_pokemon?
In the late 90's/early 2000's the global hit series Pokemon featured a segment in their show called "**Who's that Pokemon**?" where the viewer would have to guess which Pokemon was being shown on their screen using only a silhouetted image.
This project aims to replicate that by testing whether or not a CNN can map a silhouetted image to a regular image with moderate accuracy.
