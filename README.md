# whos_that_pokemon
In the late 90's/early 2000's the global hit series Pokemon featured a segment in their show called "**Who's that Pokemon**?" where the viewer when presented with a silhoutte image of a Pokemon would have to guess which Pokemon was displayed on their screen. This project aims to replicate that using images from the Pokemon images dataset which can be found here

The first step was to create silhouettes of each image by removing the internal contours of each image
