# whos_that_pokemon
In the late 90's/early 2000's the global hit series Pokemon featured a segment in their show called "Who's that Pokemon" where the viewer when presented with a silhoutte image of a Pokemon would have to guess which Pokemon was displayed on their screen. This project aims to replicate that using images from the Pokemon images dataset which can be found here
