# whos_that_pokemon?
In the late 90's/early 2000's the global hit series Pokemon featured a segment in their show called "**Who's that Pokemon**?" where the viewer when presented with a silhoutte image of a Pokemon would have to guess which Pokemon was displayed on their screen.
This project aims to replicate that using images from the Pokemon images dataset which can be found here:
[Pokemon Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset)
![Pokemon Silhouette](https://github.com/JayJJamesJr/whos_that_pokemon/blob/main/pokemon_silhouette.jpg)

The first step was to create silhouettes of each image by removing their internal contours
